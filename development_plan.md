## Design Checklist (High Aesthetic)

- [ ] Is the typography consistent (Outfit/Inter)?
- [ ] Are callouts visually distinct and accessible?
- [ ] Are all images high-fidelity (no generic clip-art)?
- [ ] Are transitions smooth (0.2s-0.3s ease)?
- [ ] Is brand neutrality maintained (No TSU branding)?
