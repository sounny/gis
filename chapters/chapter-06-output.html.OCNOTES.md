## Completed Adaptations (February 2026)

- [x] **Interactive Module:** Added "Format Selection Guide" with 6 real-world export scenarios (Web Image, Print, Archive, Interactive Web, Mobile, GIS Data Export), each revealing the recommended format, its strengths, and use cases.
- [x] **Local-to-Global Sidebar:** Detailed Texas Connection featuring the General Land Office (GLO) 2.5+ million historical maps, the challenge of balancing preservation (archival TIFF), access (web PNG/JPEG), and privacy in digital releases. Parallels to European cadastral archives.
- [x] **Critical GIS Prompt:** "Public Maps & Privacy" dilemma asking students to choose between full transparency, two-tiered access (public simplified + professional detailed), or complete privacy, reflecting real county parcel data governance tensions.
- [x] **Educational Enhancement:** Added "The Politics and Ethics of Map Output" section emphasizing that format choice is not merely technical but deeply political, with implications for access, privacy, and power dynamics.
