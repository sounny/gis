## Proposed adaptation to the book (concrete next edits for another agent)

- Interactive module candidates:
  - Ethics simulator extension: choose data resolution/aggregation, see privacy risk vs utility score; require a written justification.
- Local-to-Global sidebar: search within the listed reference sources for a Texas anchor (Houston, Galveston, Austin, DFW, Rio Grande, Permian Basin) and write a 120-180 word sidebar that ends with a global parallel.
- 'Important Persons' bio box: if any reference source includes an inventor/author tied to this topic, add a 1-paragraph bio + 3 bullets (impact, algorithm/idea, modern use).
- Critical GIS prompt: add 1 dilemma question connected to the chapter's primary dataset choice (scale, privacy, bias, uncertainty) and ask for a written justification.

## Completed Adaptations (January 2026)

- [x] **Interactive module:** "Ethics Simulator" implemented.
- [x] **Local-to-Global:** Added "Redlining in Austin" sidebar.
- [x] **Important Persons:** Added Bio Box for William Bunge.
- [x] **Critical GIS:** Added "The Data Double" callout regarding surveillance capitalism.
- [x] **Geographic Inquiry:** Added "Asking Questions of Where" prompt.
- [x] **GIS as an Art:** Added "The Art of Persuasion" callout.
- [x] **Interdisciplinary GIS:** Added "Philosophy & Law" callout.
