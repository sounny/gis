## Sidebar: GIS Is an Art

GIS is an art because it turns messy reality into a deliberate visual argument. Every dataset is a material (pixels, points, lines), and every map is a composition that directs attention, reveals pattern, and makes a claim about what matters. In this chapter on Chapter 10: Foundations of Remote Sensing (10 remote sensing), treat the workflow like studio practice: iterate, compare alternatives, and explain your design choices (not just the button clicks).

Prompts:
- Studio move: make two versions of the same map/output (clean vs expressive) and write 3 sentences on what story each tells.
- Constraint exercise: limit yourself to 2 colors + 1 accent; what becomes clearer? what becomes hidden?
- Craft check: name one choice you made for clarity (legibility) and one choice you made for feeling (mood).

## Sidebar: Asking Questions of Where

Before tools, start with the question of where. 'Where' is not only a location; it is a relationship: near/far, inside/outside, connected/disconnected, changing/stable. For Chapter 10: Foundations of Remote Sensing (10 remote sensing), the best work comes from translating a curiosity into a spatial test you can run and explain.

Prompts:
- Where is it concentrated, and compared to what baseline?
- Where does it change sharply (boundaries) vs gradually (surfaces)?
- Where is the data missing, biased, or uncertain?
- Where would you stand on the ground to verify it (a field check plan)?

## Sidebar: Interdisciplinary Thinking

GIS becomes powerful when it borrows methods and questions from other fields. A single layer is rarely the point; the point is how a spatial pattern intersects with people, policy, environmental processes, and technology. Use Chapter 10: Foundations of Remote Sensing (10 remote sensing) as a bridge: pick a second discipline and ask what it would consider 'evidence' in your map.

Prompts:
- Public health: what exposure or access pattern is visible (or invisible) at your chosen scale?
- Urban planning: what zoning/transport constraint changes the interpretation of your result?
- Ecology/climate: what seasonal or physical process could explain the pattern?
- Economics: who pays, who benefits, and what is the spatial footprint of that tradeoff?
