## Proposed adaptation to the book (concrete next edits for another agent)

- Interactive module candidates:
  - Trilateration simulator: drag satellites, watch intersection/error ellipse change; add 'urban canyon' multipath toggle.
  - Spectral slider: move wavelength slider across EM spectrum and reveal what sensors 'see'; pair with a Texas target (Houston heat, coastal water, agriculture).
- Local-to-Global sidebar: search within the listed reference sources for a Texas anchor (Houston, Galveston, Austin, DFW, Rio Grande, Permian Basin) and write a 120-180 word sidebar that ends with a global parallel.
- 'Important Persons' bio box: if any reference source includes an inventor/author tied to this topic, add a 1-paragraph bio + 3 bullets (impact, algorithm/idea, modern use).
- Critical GIS prompt: add 1 dilemma question connected to the chapter's primary dataset choice (scale, privacy, bias, uncertainty) and ask for a written justification.

## Completed Adaptations (January 2026)

- [x] **Local-to-Global:** Added "Texas Connection: Monitoring the 2011 Drought" sidebar.
- [x] **Important Persons:** Added Bio Box for Virginia T. Norwood (Mother of Landsat).
- [x] **Critical GIS:** Added "The Privacy Pixel" callout regarding resolution and surveillance.
- [x] **Theory Expansion:** Added "Passive vs. Active Sensors" section.
- [x] **Theory Expansion:** Added "The Physics of Orbits" (Geo/Polar/Sun-Sync) section.
- [ ] **Interactive module:** (Planned) Interactive Resolution Comparison (Slide to blur).
