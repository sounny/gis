## Proposed adaptation to the book (concrete next edits for another agent)

- Interactive module candidates:
  - Legend lab: interactive map where students change classification (quantiles/jenks/equal interval) and see how the story changes; include a 'bad map' toggle.
  - Scrollytelling template: 4 panels + map state transitions; students swap in their own Texas case study.
  - AI map critique: show model output heatmap + threshold slider; students label failure modes (bias, overfit, spurious correlation).
- Local-to-Global sidebar: search within the listed reference sources for a Texas anchor (Houston, Galveston, Austin, DFW, Rio Grande, Permian Basin) and write a 120-180 word sidebar that ends with a global parallel.
- 'Important Persons' bio box: if any reference source includes an inventor/author tied to this topic, add a 1-paragraph bio + 3 bullets (impact, algorithm/idea, modern use).
- Critical GIS prompt: add 1 dilemma question connected to the chapter's primary dataset choice (scale, privacy, bias, uncertainty) and ask for a written justification.

## Completed Adaptations (January 2026)

- [x] **Interactive module:** "Scrollytelling Demo" implemented.
- [x] **Local-to-Global:** Added "The Texas Slavery Project" sidebar.
- [x] **Important Persons:** Added Bio Box for Allen Carroll (Esri StoryMaps).
- [x] **Critical GIS:** Added "The Danger of a Single Story" callout regarding narrative bias.
- [x] **Geographic Inquiry:** Added "Asking Questions of Where" prompt.
- [x] **GIS as an Art:** Added "The Narrative Arc" callout.
- [x] **Interdisciplinary GIS:** Added "Digital Humanities" callout.
