Learning Scaffold Component

Files
- HTML snippet: `chapters/_components/learning-scaffold.html`
- Styles: `css/style.css` (section: "LEARNING SCAFFOLD")

Where to insert
- In each chapter page, place the snippet inside `<main class="container">`, after the back-navigation and before the first content card.

How to fill it
- Prereqs: 0-3 items (prior chapters or skills)
- Time: split read/practice (e.g., "25 min read + 20 min practice")
- Deliverable: one concrete artifact (map layout, GeoJSON, short report, screenshot + caption)
- Outcomes: 3-7 measurable verbs (define, compute, interpret, critique, validate)
- Stop & check: 3-5 questions using <details> so answers are hidden by default
- Try it: a 5-minute micro-task that builds toward the lab
- Lab: two tracks (Desktop GIS + Earth Engine) that converge on the same deliverable type
- Common mistakes: symptom -> fix phrasing
- Further reading: 1-3 citations/links

Design notes
- Uses existing global design tokens in `css/style.css`.
- Avoids institution-specific branding.
- Uses semantic HTML (lists, details/summary) and is keyboard-friendly by default.
