## Proposed adaptation to the book (concrete next edits for another agent)

- Interactive module candidates:
  - Model picker: give 6 real questions (pipes, flood surface, landcover, parcels, temperature, crime points) and have students choose vector/raster + why; reveal tradeoffs (file size, topology, mixed pixels).
  - Vector overlay playground: buffer distance slider, live area/feature count updates; show dissolve vs no-dissolve.
- Local-to-Global sidebar: search within the listed reference sources for a Texas anchor (Houston, Galveston, Austin, DFW, Rio Grande, Permian Basin) and write a 120-180 word sidebar that ends with a global parallel.
- 'Important Persons' bio box: if any reference source includes an inventor/author tied to this topic, add a 1-paragraph bio + 3 bullets (impact, algorithm/idea, modern use).
- Critical GIS prompt: add 1 dilemma question connected to the chapter's primary dataset choice (scale, privacy, bias, uncertainty) and ask for a written justification.

## Completed Adaptations (January 2026)

- [x] **Interactive module:** "Overlay Visualizer" implemented.
- [x] **Local-to-Global:** Added "Gerrymandering in Texas" sidebar.
- [x] **Important Persons:** Added Bio Box for Stan Openshaw (MAUP).
- [x] **Critical GIS:** Added "Digital Redlining" callout regarding service area buffers.
