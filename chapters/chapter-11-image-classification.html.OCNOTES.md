## Proposed adaptation to the book (concrete next edits for another agent)

- Interactive module candidates:
  - Legend lab: interactive map where students change classification (quantiles/jenks/equal interval) and see how the story changes; include a 'bad map' toggle.
  - Classifier simulator: pick training points on a tiny image, run a toy classifier, then compute confusion matrix + overall/producer/user accuracy.
  - AI map critique: show model output heatmap + threshold slider; students label failure modes (bias, overfit, spurious correlation).
- Local-to-Global sidebar: search within the listed reference sources for a Texas anchor (Houston, Galveston, Austin, DFW, Rio Grande, Permian Basin) and write a 120-180 word sidebar that ends with a global parallel.
- 'Important Persons' bio box: if any reference source includes an inventor/author tied to this topic, add a 1-paragraph bio + 3 bullets (impact, algorithm/idea, modern use).
- Critical GIS prompt: add 1 dilemma question connected to the chapter's primary dataset choice (scale, privacy, bias, uncertainty) and ask for a written justification.
