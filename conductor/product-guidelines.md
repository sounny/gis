# Product Guidelines

## Instructional Tone
- **Conversational & Applied:** Use direct, "you-focused" language. Prioritize clarity and practical problem-solving over dense academic prose.
- **Active Voice:** Instructions should be concise and action-oriented (e.g., "Open the attribute table" instead of "The attribute table should be opened").

## Visual Aesthetic
- **Modern & Minimalist:** High contrast, clean lines, and a neutral palette. Use a single bold accent color (e.g., Coral or Teal) for primary calls to action.
- **Typography:** Sans-serif fonts for main body text to ensure readability on digital screens.

## Layout & Components
- **Sidebars (Case Studies/Local-to-Global):** Distinguish with a light grey background and a subtle vertical border accent in the project's primary color.
- **Multi-Platform Instructions:** Use **Color-Coded Blocks** to distinguish between software platforms. For example:
    - **Blue Box:** ArcGIS Pro
    - **Green Box:** QGIS
    - **Orange Box:** Web GIS / ArcGIS Online
- **Visual Aids:** 
    - Use high-resolution screenshots for individual, static steps.
    - Use short (5-10s) looping GIFs to demonstrate complex UI interactions or tool behaviors.

## Accessibility
- All images must include descriptive Alt-text.
- Color coding in instruction blocks must be supplemented with text labels (e.g., "Software: QGIS") to support color-blind users.
