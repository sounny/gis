## Strongest reference sources (overall)
- (No matching reference sources found by simple term search.)

## Candidate excerpts to adapt (verbatim seeds; paraphrase into the chapter)
- (None automatically selected.)

## Reference matches by concept (top hits)

- (No per-concept hits found; consider searching references by synonyms.)

## Proposed adaptation to the book (concrete next edits for another agent)
- Interactive module candidates: (none auto-suggested; see AGENTS.md decision matrix)
- Local-to-Global sidebar: search within the listed reference sources for a Texas anchor (Houston, Galveston, Austin, DFW, Rio Grande, Permian Basin) and write a 120-180 word sidebar that ends with a global parallel.
- 'Important Persons' bio box: if any reference source includes an inventor/author tied to this topic, add a 1-paragraph bio + 3 bullets (impact, algorithm/idea, modern use).
- Critical GIS prompt: add 1 dilemma question connected to the chapter's primary dataset choice (scale, privacy, bias, uncertainty) and ask for a written justification.
