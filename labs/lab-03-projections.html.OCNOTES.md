## Strongest reference sources (overall)
- (No matching reference sources found by simple term search.)

## Reference matches by concept (top hits)

## Proposed adaptation to the book (draft ideas)
- Pull 1-2 short definitions/examples from the “Strongest reference sources” into this chapter’s narrative blocks (paraphrase; keep citations).
- Add a Texas “Local to Global” sidebar seeded by any Texas-relevant example found in references (search within top sources for “Texas”, “Houston”, “Austin”, “Galveston”, “Travis”, “Harris”).
- Convert any step-by-step reference exercise into a lightweight simulator (Vanilla JS + Canvas/DOM) rather than screenshots; keep the original dataset/story.
- If a reference contains a named researcher/pioneer, turn it into an “Important Persons” bio box with 3 bullets: contribution, why it matters to this chapter, and a modern application.
- Add an ethics prompt (privacy/bias/uncertainty) if the reference material includes data collection or classification decisions.
