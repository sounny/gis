Pedagogical Audit (Page-by-Page)
GIS Online Textbook
Date: 2026-01-23

Scope
- Reviewed the HTML chapter pages under `chapters/` (Chapter 00 through Chapter 20).
- Goal: identify concrete ways to make each lesson more comprehensive, teachable, and assessment-aligned.
- Emphasis: Remote Sensing-first (imagery-driven workflows), global/OER audience (no institutional branding), and accessible interactivity.

Global Recommendations (apply to every chapter)
- Add a consistent learning scaffold near the top:
  - Prereqs, Time estimate, Learning outcomes (measurable verbs), Key terms
  - Stop and check (3-5 questions with feedback)
  - Try it (5-minute micro task)
  - Lab (ArcGIS Pro/QGIS track + Earth Engine track)
  - Lessons learned (5 bullets), Common mistakes, Further reading
- Upgrade all formative checks so that wrong answers:
  - reveal the correct answer
  - explain why it is correct
  - address one common misconception
  - allow reset/retry
- Accessibility defaults:
  - keyboard operation for toggles/quizzes/maps (not mouse-only)
  - visible focus styles
  - alt text for images; captions/transcripts for embedded videos
  - do not rely on color alone for correctness; provide text feedback
- Global framing:
  - avoid single-city anchoring unless clearly labeled as an optional case study
  - remove any institution-specific references; prefer global datasets/examples
- RS-first thread:
  - maintain a repeated AOI + repeated datasets across chapters (same place, same Sentinel/Landsat/LiDAR samples) to make the course feel like one coherent workflow.
