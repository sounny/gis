## Proposed adaptation to the book (concrete next edits for another agent)
- Interactive module candidates:
  - Model picker: give 6 real questions (pipes, flood surface, landcover, parcels, temperature, crime points) and have students choose vector/raster + why; reveal tradeoffs (file size, topology, mixed pixels).
  - Spectral slider: move wavelength slider across EM spectrum and reveal what sensors 'see'; pair with a Texas target (Houston heat, coastal water, agriculture).
  - Ethics simulator extension: choose data resolution/aggregation, see privacy risk vs utility score; require a written justification.
  - Reproducibility checklist widget: interactive checklist that generates a 'methods + data' appendix skeleton.
- Local-to-Global sidebar: search within the listed reference sources for a Texas anchor (Houston, Galveston, Austin, DFW, Rio Grande, Permian Basin) and write a 120-180 word sidebar that ends with a global parallel.
- 'Important Persons' bio box: if any reference source includes an inventor/author tied to this topic, add a 1-paragraph bio + 3 bullets (impact, algorithm/idea, modern use).
- Critical GIS prompt: add 1 dilemma question connected to the chapter's primary dataset choice (scale, privacy, bias, uncertainty) and ask for a written justification.
